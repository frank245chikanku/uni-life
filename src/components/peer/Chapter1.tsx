      <h2>Phase 1: Understanding Peer Pressure</h2> 
      <p>
      Peer pressure is a very real issue that affects many of the teenagers of the world today. It 
is a normal part of growing up. Peer Pressure is basically a social pressure. This can be 
from family members, friends or those persons who work together. When we think of the 
words “peer pressure’, what is the first thing that comes to mind? Majority of us would 
say that  peer pressure  is an  influence from friends  or classmates  to do  something we 
normally do not follow as a routine.  Peer pressure is the direct  influence on people by 
peers  who get  encouraged to  follow  their  peers  by  changing their  habits,  values  and 
behavior. The ‘teenage’ is the age when peer pressure plays a vital role. Peer pressure can 
be both  positive as well as  negative.  Its  upto  the  individual to  make best out of every 
situation.  Peer  pressure  may always  be there-we  have to  use  it wisely  as  we navigate 
through life.
