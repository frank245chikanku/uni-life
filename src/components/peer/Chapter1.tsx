        This phase focuses on understanding what peer pressure is, its sources,
        and how it can influence individuals, particularly in social settings
        like schools and universities. It aims to raise awareness of the
        different forms of peer pressure, both positive and negative, and
        encourages self-reflection on personal experiences with peer influence.
