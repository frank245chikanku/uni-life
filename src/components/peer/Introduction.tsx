      <h2>Introduction to peer pressure</h2>
      <p>
      Peer pressure or influence is a common occurrence in university life. Naturally, 
      those around you influence your life in one way or the other. You were not born with your own character or lifestyle. 
      The society or community around you contributes to who you are. The question many ask is, how influential are those people in your life? It could be positive or negative. 
      The university community is full of people from different walks of life. And learning one thing or the other from your peers is part of the process. As such,
       peer pressure or influence is part of every student’s journey. Many students often find themselves in situations where they are pressured to conform to the expectations of their peers. 
       It can be in terms of social behavior, 
      academic performance, or lifestyle choices. Whereas peer influence can be positive,
       it can also have negative consequences.
       Peer pressure or influence is a phenomenon that occurs when the opinions, behaviors, or attitudes of your peers influence you. As mentioned earlier, it can be positive or negative. Positive peer influence can help you improve your academic performance, develop social skills, and build self-confidence. Negative peer influence, on the other hand, can lead to unhealthy behaviors i.e. drug use, drinking, or reckless behavior.

       If you understand the nature of the influence, 
       you’ll make informed decisions and avoid negative consequences.
