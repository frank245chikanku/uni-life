        Introduction to Academic Integrity
      </h2>
      <p className="text-start text-lg">
      Academic Integrity, much like personal integrity,
       is a reflection of a studentâ€™s character. 
       The purpose of higher education is to provide the opportunity for students to learn and gain knowledge that supports whatever career field they choose. To learn, 
       students must be actively engaged, and this often includes navigating difficult courses and challenging situations. It is those challenges that often create the test of individual character. 
       How will you respond when you have not prepared appropriately or managed time wisely? When you have been struggling throughout with course content, or are navigating personal circumstances that interfere with focus or course commitment? 
       How will you respond when you believe your peers are engaging in dishonest behavior, and you are falling behind yourself? What decisions will you make in these situations, and how will this define your academic integrity?
