        Understanding how to avoid plagiarism is not just a student problem, staff also need support and
education to teach students. Some lecturers may not have experienced the explicit teaching of
acknowledgment skills when they were students, some may not have learnt how to teach such
academic skills in their professional education, and some, having become acculturated into
academic culture and their discipline may not be conscious of all the skills that
students need to master in order to successfully construct an academic text. Strategies to redress
this could include face-to-face and online workshops. Registration in these could be tied to
professional development to ensure that staff take advantage of such workshops. Also useful
would be models and teaching examples which can be adapted, and guides which are available
when staff need them. Presenting information in an
appealing way is strategic. At Swinburne University, workshops to explain the university‟s
approach to dealing with plagiarism were knowingly titled “Quick Fix” workshops.
From a learning perspective, the development of citation skills takes time and practice and
requires explanation, guidance and modelling. Formative assessment can be a means for
students to learn how to avoid plagiarism, attribute sources and use quotations to provide
evidence. While explanations about the problem of plagiarism and models of good practice can
be accessed on websites and through class activities, without the impetus of assessment,
students would be unlikely to use these sources. In fact, for most people, the need to
acknowledge sources only happens when they make texts for assessment because this is when
they have an audience. Students are alert to assessment, and feedback from assessment is a
