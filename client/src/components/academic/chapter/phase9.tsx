        Acting on Feedback
      </h1>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Acting on feedback is essential for personal and professional growth. It involves actively 
        listening to constructive criticism, reflecting on it, and taking intentional steps to make 
        improvements. By embracing feedback, individuals show a commitment to continuous learning and 
        development. Rather than viewing feedback as a setback, it should be seen as a valuable tool 
        that guides decision-making, fosters skill development, and strengthens relationships within 
        teams and communities.
