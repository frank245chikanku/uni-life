        Plagiarism can also include re-using your own work without citation. Under the regulations for examinations, intentional or reckless plagiarism is a disciplinary offence.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        The necessity to acknowledge others’ work or ideas applies not only to text but also to other media, such as computer code, illustrations, and graphs. It applies equally to published text and data drawn from books and journals, and to unpublished text and data, whether from lectures, theses, or other students’ essays. You must also attribute text, data, or other resources downloaded from websites.

        The best way of avoiding plagiarism is to learn and employ the principles of good academic practice from the beginning of your university career. Avoiding plagiarism is not simply a matter of making sure your references are all correct or changing enough words so the examiner will not notice your paraphrase; it is about deploying your academic skills to make your work as good as it can be.
