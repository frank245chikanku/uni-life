        Check-Ins for Integrity
      </h1>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Integrity involves being consistent in promoting and supporting organizational values and between words and action; being predictable in the face of adversity; following strong morals and ethics; being true to oneself;
        communicating openly; using non-threatening language; remaining calm; being non-judgemental, safe, and co-operative; and showing an interest in understanding othersâ€™ points of view.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Breaches of integrity are not always character issues; they can be due to a deficit of leadership skills. The following tips require core skills such as emotional intelligence, communication,
        mental fitness, conflict resolution, and problem-solving.
