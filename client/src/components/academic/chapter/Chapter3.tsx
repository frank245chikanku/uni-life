          Setting the right tone is crucial for fostering a positive and productive environment. Whether in academic settings, workplaces, or personal relationships, the tone you set influences interactions and outcomes. It involves establishing clear expectations, promoting respect, and encouraging open communication.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Setting the tone early is critical. All eyes are on you as the new leader, so make it count. Create a buzz, set an example, show your priorities, establish the mood, and be present. These actions help define your leadership and foster future collaboration.
