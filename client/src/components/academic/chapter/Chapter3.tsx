          Creating integrity pledges involves crafting clear, actionable commitments that reflect
          one's dedication to upholding ethical standards and honesty. These pledges are not just
          symbolic, but serve as a personal promise to act with integrity in both professional
          and academic settings.

          Setting the right tone is crucial for fostering a positive and productive environment.
          Whether in academic settings, workplaces, or personal relationships, the tone you set
          influences interactions and outcomes. It involves establishing clear expectations,
          promoting respect, and encouraging open communication. By setting a constructive tone,
          you create an atmosphere where individuals feel valued, motivated, and empowered to
          achieve their best work.

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
          Setting the tone early is critical. All eyes are on you as the new leader, so make it count.
          Create a buzz, set an example, show your priorities, establish the mood, and be present.
          These activities will let your team know what kind of leader you are and what your expectations are.
          This will help you down the line when you need their help to tackle the tough issues.

          Integrity involves being consistent in promoting and supporting organizational values and between words and action; being predictable in the face of adversity; following strong morals and ethics; being true to oneself;
          communicating openly; using non-threatening language; remaining calm; being non-judgemental, safe, and co-operative; and showing an interest in understanding others‚Äô points of view.

          Breaches of integrity are not always character issues; they can be due to a deficit of leadership skills. The following tips require core skills such as emotional intelligence, communication,
          mental fitness, conflict resolution, and problem-solving.

          Acting on feedback is essential for personal and professional growth. It involves actively
          listening to constructive criticism, reflecting on it, and taking intentional steps to make
          improvements. By embracing feedback, individuals show a commitment to continuous learning and
          development. Rather than viewing feedback as a setback, it should be seen as a valuable tool
          that guides decision-making, fosters skill development, and strengthens relationships within
          teams and communities.
