        Setting the Right Tone
      </h1>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Setting the right tone is crucial for fostering a positive and productive environment.
        Whether in academic settings, workplaces, or personal relationships, the tone you set
        influences interactions and outcomes. It involves establishing clear expectations,
        promoting respect, and encouraging open communication. By setting a constructive tone,
        you create an atmosphere where individuals feel valued, motivated, and empowered to
        achieve their best work.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Setting the tone early is critical. All eyes are on you as the new leader, so make it count.
        Create a buzz, set an example, show your priorities, establish the mood, and be present.
        These activities will let your team know what kind of leader you are and what your expectations are.
        This will help you down the line when you need their help to tackle the tough issues.
