          An academic integrity offence is commonly believed to be cheating on a
          test (e.g., copying answers from another student‚Äôs paper, using
          unauthorized materials such as a cellphone) or plagiarizing (e.g.,
          cutting and pasting from the Internet without documenting the source).
          However, an academic integrity offence involves more than just the
          above.

          <strong>Missing In-Text Citations</strong>
          <br />
          Failure to cite the sources listed at the end of your assignment within
          the written portion of your assignment is a form of academic
          misconduct. You must show where your research has been used in your
          written work in order for your professor to accurately assess and
          provide meaningful feedback about how well you have applied the
          knowledge you have developed.

          <strong>Improper Research Practices</strong>
          <br />
          Research involves collection, analysis, and interpretation of published
          information or data. When this information is not accurately
          represented in your academic work, such as falsifying or fabricating
          the information, this is an act of academic misconduct.
