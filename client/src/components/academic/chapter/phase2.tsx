      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The roles and responsibilities of college and university faculty members are closely tied to the central functions of higher education. Correspondingly, college and university faculty members undertake research, teaching, and service roles to carry out the academic work of their respective institutions. Each of these roles enables faculty members to generate and disseminate knowledge to peers, students, and external audiences. 
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        The balance among teaching, research, and service, however, differs widely across institution types and by terms of the faculty member's appointment. The teaching role of faculty members reflects their centrality in addressing the primary educational mission among colleges and universities. As faculty members teach, they disseminate and impart basic or applied knowledge to students and assist students with the learning process and applying the knowledge.
