        There are some roles and responsibilities of a student that should and need to be performed during school life. By being respectful, students contribute to a healthy learning environment and lessen distractions and disciplinary actions. They are also expected to be punctual. Being late for school creates a negative impression, which can hurt their grades. Thus, they need to maintain discipline in the classroom and understand time management.

        School plays an important role in the process of socializing. An educational environment is required to ensure students gain access to quality education. To exist in such a setting, students are expected to comply with behavioral expectations and display values such as politeness, kindness, compassion, generosity, sympathy, and respect.
