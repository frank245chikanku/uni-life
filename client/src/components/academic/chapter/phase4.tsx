      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Integrity means being honest and having strong moral principles. A person with integrity behaves ethically and does the right thing, even behind closed doors. Having integrity means that you are honest, ethical, and follow defined moral principles. 
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Integrity at work is about even more than honesty and respect. If an organization has a true culture of integrity, employees take their commitments seriously, are proactive when they donâ€™t understand their responsibilities, and ultimately are accountable for their results. As a result, the business thrives.
