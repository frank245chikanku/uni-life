        Phase 2: Implementing Best Practices

        Understanding how to avoid plagiarism is not just a student problem; staff also need support and
        education to teach students. Some lecturers may not have experienced the explicit teaching of
        acknowledgment skills when they were students, some may not have learnt how to teach such
        academic skills in their professional education, and some, having become acculturated into
        academic culture and their discipline, may not be conscious of all the skills that
        students need to master in order to successfully construct an academic text.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Strategies to redress this could include face-to-face and online workshops. Registration in these could be tied to
        professional development to ensure that staff take advantage of such workshops. Also useful
        would be models and teaching examples which can be adapted, and guides which are available
        when staff need them. Presenting information in an appealing way is strategic. At Swinburne University,
        workshops to explain the university’s approach to dealing with plagiarism were knowingly titled “Quick Fix” workshops.

        From a learning perspective, the development of citation skills takes time and practice and
        requires explanation, guidance, and modelling. Formative assessment can be a means for
        students to learn how to avoid plagiarism, attribute sources, and use quotations to provide
        evidence.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        While explanations about the problem of plagiarism and models of good practice can be accessed on websites and through class activities, without the impetus of assessment, students would be unlikely to use these sources. In fact, for most people, the need to
        acknowledge sources only happens when they make texts for assessment because this is when
        they have an audience. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Students are alert to assessment, and feedback from assessment is a critical motivator for their engagement with academic integrity practices. This external pressure encourages them to understand the importance of acknowledging sources and adhering to ethical standards, as they recognize that doing so not only impacts their grades but also contributes to their growth as responsible learners and professionals.
