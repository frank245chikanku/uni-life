        Providing education and professional development ensures that students, instructors, and staff are aware of policies and procedures related to cheating, plagiarism, and reporting academic misconduct—specifically who to contact, how, when, and what evidence to provide. It is important that the range of possible consequences is appropriate to the nature of offenses and that stakeholders are aware of the variations among them. Administrator accountability includes budgeting for resources and assistance for pursuing alleged cases and ensuring instructors and staff have the skills needed. Administrative championship of academic integrity is essential; without leadership commitment, there will be little compliance from the rest of the institution.

        Multiple respondents stressed that compliance and commitment, including taking potential misconduct cases seriously, need to be demonstrated by administrators as well as instructors and students. Instructors should keep in mind that they are role models in their writing and teaching. Faculty demonstrate their commitment by changing assessments frequently and ensuring that they are interesting, meaningful, and relevant to students’ lives. Instructors are expected to comply with academic integrity policies and to follow stated procedures, but they must feel competent and supported to do so. Ensuring that students understand and observe the guidelines for effective academic writing and avoiding misconduct is evidence of commitment. Their diligence in these tasks should be rewarded rather than dismissed by administrators.

        In line with our findings and interpretations, we encourage a balanced strategy for supporting academic integrity that considers the three key areas of concern we identified. We learned that policy and procedures, compliance and commitment, and resources are interdependent. Participants suggested that failing to achieve balance weakens overall academic integrity. For example, for faculty to comply, they depend on resources and support for their commitment, as well as on the guidelines provided, while administrators may tend to focus on the quasi-legal aspects of policy and procedures.
