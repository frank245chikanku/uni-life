      <h2>Phase 4: Promoting a Culture of Integrity</h2>
      <p>
        Much has been written in recent years about honesty and integrity in the classroom. Academic integrity is a core value in our schools—for teaching, learning, and scholarly activities. However, the education literature contains a myriad of reports suggesting that cheating and plagiarizing by students have increased in recent years. The ready availability of technology has contributed to student behaviors ranging from cutting and pasting material from the Internet to sharing online quizzes and texting answers to classmates.

        Many important steps have been taken within the academy to achieve a culture of academic integrity. Starting on the first day of professional and graduate programs, we must instill the principles of professionalism as an essential step in developing our culture of academic integrity. Assessing students in performance-based and problem-solving examinations rather than multiple-choice tests is another strategy to shift the focus to learning and away from an emphasis on getting high grades. In addition, we need to articulate the elements of scientific integrity and professionalism during interactions with faculty members, rotations in laboratories, and in all group research activities for graduate students.

        Technology will surround students during their education and when they become pharmacists, scientists, and educators. We should embrace technology and allow its use to the fullest and logical extent to enhance education, research, and service missions—while educating students about appropriate use and encouraging them to think critically and ethically about new challenges associated with advancing technologies such as cloud computing, mobile computing, and open content. Students should collaborate with others not just to complete work and projects, but to learn in the process and enhance their critical-thinking and problem-solving skills. That is the message we must articulate each and every day if we are to truly promote a culture of academic integrity.
