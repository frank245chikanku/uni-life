        Phase 4: Promoting a Culture of Integrity
      </h2>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Much has been written in recent years about honesty and integrity in the
        classroom. Academic integrity is a core value in our schools—for
        teaching, learning, and scholarly activities. However, the education
        literature contains a myriad of reports suggesting that cheating and
        plagiarizing by students have increased in recent years. The ready
        availability of technology has contributed to student behaviors ranging
        from cutting and pasting material from the Internet to sharing online
        quizzes and texting answers to classmates.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Many important steps have been taken within the academy to achieve a
        culture of academic integrity. Starting on the first day of professional
        and graduate programs, we must instill the principles of professionalism
        as an essential step in developing our culture of academic integrity.
        Assessing students in performance-based and problem-solving examinations
        rather than multiple-choice tests is another strategy to shift the focus
        to learning and away from an emphasis on getting high grades. In
        addition, we need to articulate the elements of scientific integrity and
        professionalism during interactions with faculty members, rotations in
        laboratories, and in all group research activities for graduate
        students.

        Technology will surround students during their education and when they
        become pharmacists, scientists, and educators. We should embrace
        technology and allow its use to the fullest and logical extent to
        enhance education, research, and service missions—while educating
        students about appropriate use and encouraging them to think critically
        and ethically about new challenges associated with advancing
        technologies such as cloud computing, mobile computing, and open
        content. Students should collaborate with others not just to complete
        work and projects, but to learn in the process and enhance their
        critical-thinking and problem-solving skills. That is the message we
        must articulate each and every day if we are to truly promote a culture
        of academic integrity.
