        Phase 1: Understanding Academic Integrity
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Academic integrity is an interdisciplinary concept that provides the
        foundation for every aspect and all levels of education. The term evokes
        strong emotions in teachers, researchers, and students—not least because
        it is usually associated with negative behaviors.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        When considering academic integrity, the discussion tends to revolve
        around cheating, plagiarism, dishonesty, fraud, and other academic
        malpractice and how best to prevent these behaviors. A more productive
        approach entails a focus on promoting the positive values of honesty,
        trust, fairness, respect, responsibility, and courage as the
        intrinsically motivated drivers for ethical academic practice.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Academic integrity is much more than “a student issue” and requires
        commitment from all stakeholders in the academic community, including
        undergraduate and postgraduate students, teachers, established
        researchers, senior managers, policymakers, support staff, and
        administrators.
