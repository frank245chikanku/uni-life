      <h1>Prepare for Extreme Outcomes</h1>
      <p>
        In any venture, whether it’s entrepreneurship, investments, or personal projects, it’s important to mentally prepare for both the best and worst-case scenarios. Preparing for extreme outcomes means 
        acknowledging the possibility of dramatic success or failure, and being ready to handle both. This mindset helps reduce the emotional impact of unexpected results, whether it’s a windfall of success or 
        an unforeseen failure. By preparing for extremes, you create contingency plans, diversify your approach, and build resilience. You become more equipped to deal with setbacks and more confident in 
        celebrating successes. This mental preparation also encourages calculated risk-taking, as you become less afraid of the unknown and more confident in your ability to adapt to changing circumstances.
