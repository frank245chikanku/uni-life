      <h1>Understand Optionality</h1>
      <p>
        Optionality refers to the ability to maintain flexibility and explore multiple opportunities or paths without being tied down to a single decision. In entrepreneurship, having optionality means 
        that you are not constrained by one rigid plan or course of action. This can be a powerful approach, as it allows you to adapt to changing circumstances, experiment with different strategies, 
        and make decisions with a wider range of possible outcomes in mind. By understanding optionality, you recognize the importance of diversifying your risks, investments, and decisions. Rather than 
        committing to a single idea or path, you create room to pivot, innovate, and capitalize on emerging opportunities. This mindset helps entrepreneurs navigate uncertainty and increase their chances of success.
