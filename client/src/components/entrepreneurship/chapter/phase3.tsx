        Optionality is the state of having options. It’s a context where you can select from a set of choices without being under any obligation to do so. We usually have a common-sense understanding of the term. Who amongst us hasn’t used the phrase ‘let’s keep our options open’ at least once in their life? Optionality is about options that are available to you.

        Strategic optionality involves using options in a strategic way, to understand their payoffs, and selectively acting on them. In the same common-sensical way, we know that options are most useful in a context of uncertainty, when the future is uncertain, and you are unsure of the best way forward. We take common-sense as our starting point and delve deeper into the idea here in this chapter.

        Optionality is a powerful tool that can be harnessed to create value in many different ways. However, it is also a complex concept that requires a deep understanding of the underlying assets and markets. In this section, we will explore the concept of optionality in more detail and provide insights from different points of view.
