        When entrepreneurs encounter unexpected events, they have to attend to relational and temporal commitments simultaneously.

        Pivoting and perseverance require a recalibration of the temporal commitments associated with venture ideas.

        <li>To persevere, entrepreneurs position actions as continuation of the past, extend timelines and complexify temporal ordering.</li>
        <li>To pivot, they reposition actions on a revised timeline by reinterpreting the past to align with a new projected future.</li>

        Given the uncertainties surrounding entrepreneurship, entrepreneurs are likely to confront unexpected events when they pursue their venture ideas. Upon encountering such events, entrepreneurs may decide to persevere with their original ideas to maintain legitimacy in the eyes of stakeholders. Alternatively, they may pivot to deal with the unfolding contexts they are confronted with. Overall, entrepreneurs face tensions between continuity and change, which they must address.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Whether choosing to persevere by building on the past or pivoting to redefine the future, entrepreneurs must strategically recalibrate their actions to align with evolving circumstances and stakeholder expectations. This duality demands flexibility, foresight, and the ability to reinterpret challenges as opportunities. Ultimately, success lies in an entrepreneur's ability to skillfully manage these tensions, embracing both stability and adaptation to drive their ventures forward amidst uncertainty.
