        When we aspire to show resilience we subconsciously acknowledge our ego that we know the future because we are saying we don't need to learn as we move into the future.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        We also tend to accept our mediocrity by becoming intellectually lazy and not doing the work required to shape the future.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        I don't want you to get me wrong. I like to be resilient and it isn't totally wrong but if we wish for greater things we should not get limited by the comfort resilience provides to us. We must go beyond resilience and aim for anti-fragility.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        As a property, anti-fragility can be applied in multiple spheres of our life and can be a great lens to look at various aspects that are inherently antifragile already. 
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        “Curiosity is antifragile, like an addiction, and is magnified by attempts to satisfy it — books have a secret mission and ability to multiply, as everyone who has wall-to-wall bookshelves knows well.”
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        There is a reason why people who are into lifelong learning appear to be humble because they know that they don't know a lot and any amount of pride in having learned something will only come in their way of learning more things.
