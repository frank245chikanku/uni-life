      <h1>Build Resilience, Not Fragility</h1>
      <p>
        Life is full of challenges, and how we respond to them determines our strength. Building resilience means developing the 
        ability to bounce back from adversity, learning from failures, and continuing to grow stronger in the face of setbacks. 
        Resilience empowers us to adapt, maintain our focus, and persevere when life gets tough. In contrast, fragility can 
        make us vulnerable to life's hardships, preventing us from reaching our full potential. Cultivating resilience is essential 
        for navigating the inevitable ups and downs with grace and determination.
