      <h1>Don’t Be Fooled by Randomness</h1>
      <p>
        In the world of decision-making and investing, it’s easy to fall into the trap of confusing luck with skill. Many success stories are often attributed to talent or hard work, but randomness plays 
        a significant role in outcomes. It's crucial to understand that success or failure can sometimes be the result of chance, rather than ability or strategy. Recognizing the role of randomness helps 
        you avoid overestimating your control over outcomes and reduces the temptation to take undue credit for things beyond your influence. This mindset encourages humility and a focus on systems and 
        processes rather than obsessing over short-term results, which may be influenced by factors beyond your control. By understanding randomness, you become more resilient in the face of unpredictability 
        and are less likely to make rash decisions based on temporary trends or anecdotal successes.
