      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The idea of not being fooled by randomness emphasizes the importance of recognizing the role of chance in outcomes, especially in areas like success, failure, and decision-making. Often, people attribute positive results to skill or strategy without acknowledging the impact of luck or unpredictable factors.
        <br />
        <br />
        For instance, someone might experience significant success in the stock market or a business venture, not because of superior skill, but due to favorable circumstances beyond their control. Misinterpreting such randomness can lead to overconfidence and flawed decision-making.
        <br />
        <br />
        For students and aspiring entrepreneurs, understanding this concept is vital. It encourages a focus on building resilient strategies that can withstand uncertainty and unpredictable events. It also fosters humility, as recognizing the role of luck prevents one from becoming complacent or overly reliant on what worked in the past. Instead of being misled by random success, individuals are encouraged to critically evaluate outcomes, make thoughtful decisions, and prepare for a range of possibilities. 
        <br />
        <br />
        This mindset helps in navigating the complexities of life and building sustainable paths to success.
