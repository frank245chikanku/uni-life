      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The idea of decentralizing risk is tied to the concept of not putting all resources, decisions, or operations in a single area that could potentially fail. One well-known narrative involves startups diversifying their revenue streams or operational dependencies to ensure that no single failure can collapse the entire venture.

        Students can relate to the story of how early-stage companies often experiment with multiple products or markets to see what sticks. By spreading risk, they learn which avenue generates traction while safeguarding against total loss. A compelling real-life example might include a tech company initially launching multiple apps before focusing on the most successful one, ensuring survival even if one app fails. This approach not only mitigates risks but also teaches resilience and adaptabilityâ€”qualities essential for both startups and personal growth. For students, it serves as a reminder to diversify efforts, embrace experimentation, and learn from small failures without jeopardizing the bigger vision.
