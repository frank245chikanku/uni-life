        Phase 5: Create a Monopoly Through Innovation
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Creating a monopoly through innovation means introducing new ideas or products that are so unique they give a company control over a market. 
        Patents help protect these ideas for a time, encouraging creativity and investment in new technologies. 
        For example, companies like AT&T used their innovations to grow industries, while places like Silicon Valley show how innovation can create powerful businesses.

        However, it’s important for companies to keep improving and for governments to ensure fair competition so that monopolies don’t block others from succeeding.
