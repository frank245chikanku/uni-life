        The purpose of a curious mind is an openness to learn. The purpose of a defensive mind is resisting attack. And although defensiveness can be a natural response, it's not always the best response.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Curiosity shows interest, and interest will move a conversation forward where defensiveness attempts to stop a dialogue. Whether it's politics, the pandemic, being home with your family, or zooming with your business associates, consider that curiosity is essential to cultivate.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Don't worry about being right. If you're right about something, you'll still be right after looking into the subject with others. But in the meantime, you'll create relationships that aren't rubber stamps of how you think and act.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Ask yourself if being defensive is a suitable strategy. Or is it just how you've been trained to think, lead, and act up until now. Why not use your reactions to pause, and instead of defending, initiate an inquiry? You may be surprised by the new insights you find and the genuine relationships you build. Curiosity is the path to clarity. It's not easy, but it's illuminating and humbling to find out you don't know everything.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        So, let's look and stay curious!
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        May your day be peaceful and productive.
