      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Before you announce your decision, make sure you have a clear and logical explanation for it. How did you arrive at your decision? What criteria did you use? What evidence did you consider? What assumptions did you make? By sharing your reasoning, you show respect for your audience and invite them to understand your perspective. You also demonstrate your critical thinking skills and show that you are open to scrutiny and challenge.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        No decision is perfect or risk-free. There are always uncertainties, trade-offs, and limitations involved. Instead of hiding or ignoring them, acknowledge them openly and honestly. This shows that you are aware of the complexity and nuance of the situation and that you have considered different scenarios and outcomes. It also shows that you are humble and realistic, not arrogant or dogmatic. By acknowledging uncertainties and limitations, you invite others to share their concerns and insights and help you address them.

        <strong>Seek diverse and dissenting views</strong>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        One of the best ways to encourage open dialogue is to actively seek diverse and dissenting views. Ask for feedback from people who have different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. Encourage them to challenge your assumptions, point out flaws, and offer alternatives. Listen to them with curiosity and respect, not defensiveness or hostility. By seeking diverse and dissenting views, you show that you value diversity and dissent and that you are willing to learn and improve your decision.
