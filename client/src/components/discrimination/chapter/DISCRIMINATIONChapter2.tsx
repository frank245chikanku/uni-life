        The idea that systems should be challenged, not individuals, is based on the idea that organizational problems are more likely to be caused by systemic issues than by individual actions.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Instead of confronting the person, confront the system. Create a process that will fix the problem, make things work the way you want them to work, and prevent yourself from future frustration. Once you know what system is needed, ask the co-worker involved to help you create a system that will work for both of you.
      </p>

        One such author argues that societal structures, rather than individual actions, are often the root cause of inequality, injustice, and inefficiency. Rather than focusing on tearing down individuals, the goal should be to identify and address the systemic issues that perpetuate problems.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        This perspective encourages people, including students, to critically examine institutions, policies, and broader societal frameworks, rather than scapegoating individuals for failures or shortcomings. By focusing on systemic challenges, individuals can work toward creating lasting change that improves the lives of many, rather than getting bogged down in interpersonal conflicts or blaming individuals for larger, more complex issues.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        This approach fosters unity, empathy, and long-term solutions, rather than perpetuating divisiveness and short-term blame. In challenging the system, we empower ourselves and others to create more equitable and effective structures for the future.
