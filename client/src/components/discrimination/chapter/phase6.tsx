        Thinking is one of the main tools we use to navigate life. It helps us implement actions and strategize, it helps us survive, and it can also keep us trapped in unproductive patterns.
        The first thing to accept is that you are not your thoughts. You are a being who thinks.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Thoughts are interpretations of the world around us and they are not always fact or reality. Therefore, if we understand that thoughts are our brain’s way of processing the world, we can also accept that it is possible to examine our thoughts objectively to determine what beliefs, thinking, and mental models we need to unlearn or resist.

        You should care about what you internalize because you become what you think. Lao Tzu said it like this: “Watch your thoughts, they become your words; watch your words, they become your actions; watch your actions, they become your habits; watch your habits, they become your character; watch your character, it becomes your destiny.”

        Lately, I have been thinking about it like this: my thinking is like the destination I enter into my GPS. If it is programmed with negative beliefs and mindsets, then my thinking and actions are going to take me in that direction. However, if I examine my negative thought patterns and/or resist internalizing negative thoughts, then it is like entering a new destination for my thoughts and actions to follow.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        If we are what we eat, then we also are what we think. Therefore, we need to assess whether we have practices in place that can help us examine our thoughts and prevent internalizing negativity.
