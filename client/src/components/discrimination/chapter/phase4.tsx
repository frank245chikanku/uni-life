      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        For students, emotional intelligence plays a vital role in academic success, as it helps them manage stress, communicate effectively, and collaborate with peers and teachers. It also enables them to empathize with others, creating more supportive and harmonious learning environments.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Developing emotional intelligence allows students to not only excel in their studies but also in their personal lives, as they become more adept at handling challenges, resolving conflicts, and maintaining positive relationships. Ultimately, cultivating EQ is a key factor in achieving long-term success and well-being, as it enhances emotional resilience, interpersonal skills, and the ability to lead with compassion and understanding.
