        Developing emotional intelligence allows students to not only excel in their studies but also in their personal lives, as they become more adept at handling challenges, resolving conflicts, and maintaining positive relationships. Ultimately, cultivating EQ is a key factor in achieving long-term success and well-being, as it enhances emotional resilience, interpersonal skills, and the ability to lead with compassion and understanding.
