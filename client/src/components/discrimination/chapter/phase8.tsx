      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Don’t think you’re too good for everything you do. People who have big egos tend to think that they deserve to be working at a better place, to be dating someone better, or even to be hanging out with people who are interesting and cooler. But your life is your life, and if you want better things, then you have to work to reach for them, instead of assuming the attitude that you’re not getting treated fairly. To practice humility, work to accept the life you have while striving for more without complaining.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        If you adopt the attitude that you’re too cool for school, people will become allergic to you. Instead, work to be grateful for what you have and work to earn more, if that’s what you want.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Be an optimist. People who practice humility are naturally optimistic because they don’t waste their time complaining about all of the bad things that have happened to them or dreading the future. Instead, they’re grateful for what they have and they expect good things to happen in the future. Humble people don’t expect to be given good things on a silver platter, but they do believe that good things will happen to them if they work hard enough.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Work on being excited about all of the things the future holds instead of expecting catastrophe to strike at any moment.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Though it’s a good idea to be prepared for the worst, you should work on finding the silver lining in almost every situation.
