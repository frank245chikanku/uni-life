      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Revenge often stems from a desire for personal satisfaction or to right a perceived wrong, but it rarely leads to true healing or progress. Instead, pursuing justice involves a focus on fairness, accountability, and the long-term well-being of all parties involved.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        For students and individuals navigating conflicts, this means taking a step back and considering how actions can contribute to a just outcome that upholds integrity and promotes reconciliation, rather than seeking to "get even." Justice seeks balance, respect, and a focus on the greater good, whereas revenge can perpetuate cycles of hurt and negativity.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        By prioritizing justice, we aim for a resolution that restores harmony and fosters understanding, helping to move beyond personal grievances and towards a more constructive and compassionate society. This approach leads to lasting peace and personal growth, rather than fleeting satisfaction from revenge.
