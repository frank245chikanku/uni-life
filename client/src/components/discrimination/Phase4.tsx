        Phase 4: Cultivate Resilience
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Resilience means being able to cope with tough events. When something bad happens, you still feel anger, grief, and pain, but you're able to keep going, both physically and psychologically. 
        Resilience isn't about putting up with something tough or coping on your own. 
        In fact, being able to reach out to others for support is a key part of being resilient.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        When you have resilience, you harness the inner strength that helps you rebound from a setback or challenge, such as a job loss, an illness, a disaster, or a loved one's death. 
        If you lack resilience, you might get stuck on problems or feel like a victim. 
        You might feel burdened or turn to ways to cope that aren't healthy, such as drug or alcohol use, eating disorders, or risky behaviors.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Resilience won't make your problems go away, but it can help you see past them, find ways to enjoy life, and better handle stress. 
        If you aren't as resilient as you'd like to be, you can learn skills to become more resilient.
