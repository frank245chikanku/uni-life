        Phase 3: Confront Injustice with Truth
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        All injustice affects others, so talking about justice that isn't social is like talking about water that isn't wet or a square with no right angles. 
        But the Bible's call to seek justice is not a call to superficial, kneejerk activism. 
        We are not merely commanded to execute justice, but to *"truly execute justice."* 
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        The God who commands us to seek justice is the same God who commands us to *"test everything"* and *"hold fast to what is good."*
      </p>
