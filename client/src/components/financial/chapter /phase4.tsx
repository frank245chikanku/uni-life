      <h1>Assessing Your Financial Values</h1>
      <p>
        Assessing your financial values is a critical step in aligning your spending habits with your long-term goals. 
        Financial values reflect what is most important to you—whether it’s saving for retirement, supporting family, 
        traveling, or investing in personal growth. By identifying your financial priorities, you can make more intentional 
        decisions about where to allocate your money. This process involves reflecting on your beliefs about money, 
        evaluating your past spending patterns, and adjusting your budget to reflect your core values. When your financial 
        decisions align with your values, you are more likely to feel fulfilled, less stressed about money, and motivated 
        to stay on track with your goals. Assessing your financial values is a key part of building a purposeful, 
        balanced financial life.
