      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Assessing your financial values is a crucial step toward understanding how you approach money and aligning your spending and saving habits with what truly matters to you. Your financial values are the principles and priorities that guide your decisions about earning, spending, saving, and giving.

        For students, this begins with reflecting on what you believe money represents—whether it’s security, freedom, opportunity, or a tool for helping others. Ask yourself: What do I want my money to achieve? Is it to fund my education, support my family, build a safety net, or invest in future opportunities? The Babylonians remind us that wealth grows when it serves a meaningful purpose and is managed wisely.

        When you assess your financial values, you gain clarity about where your priorities lie, making it easier to make disciplined choices. For instance, if you value education and growth, you may allocate more resources to books and courses rather than fleeting luxuries. Similarly, if generosity is important to you, you might include a portion of your budget for helping others, knowing that giving strengthens communities and builds goodwill.
      </p>

        Aligning your financial habits with your values prevents unnecessary spending on things that do not truly matter to you and helps you stay focused on achieving your goals. By regularly reassessing your financial values, you ensure that your money is not just spent but invested in creating a life of purpose, stability, and fulfillment, embodying the timeless wisdom of the Babylonians who believed that wealth flows toward those who respect its power and use it wisely.
