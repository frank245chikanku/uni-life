        Financial stability and prosperity—a lesson that is particularly valuable for students at the start of their financial journey. The text teaches that wealth is not determined by how much you earn but by how much you keep, and keeping wealth begins with knowing exactly where your money is going. Start by diligently recording every single expense, from the smallest purchase to the largest, as this creates a clear picture of your spending habits. This awareness allows you to separate your needs from your wants and ensure that your desires do not overshadow your responsibilities.

        For instance, if you’re spending excessively on non-essentials, you may find it difficult to save for critical goals such as tuition, books, or even starting a savings fund for the future. By consistently tracking expenses, you develop the habit of intentionality with your finances, learning to direct your money toward investments that create value rather than fleeting pleasures.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        As the wise men of Babylon remind us, "That which we call necessary expenses will always grow to equal our income unless we protest to the contrary." Therefore, live within your means, challenge the assumption of "necessities," and always ensure that you allocate a portion of your income toward savings and growth. This simple but powerful habit sets the foundation for financial success, giving you control over your resources and the confidence to build a secure and abundant future.
