      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Accountability ensures that you remain disciplined and responsible in your actions, particularly when it comes to managing your finances and achieving your goals. For students, this means taking ownership of your financial decisions, whether that involves tracking your expenses, saving for the future, or adhering to a budget. 
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Without accountability, it’s easy to make excuses, avoid difficult decisions, or allow distractions to derail your progress. The Babylonians understood that wealth is built on consistent actions, and they emphasized the need to commit to a plan and measure your results regularly.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        By holding yourself accountable, you ensure that your goals are not just dreams but tangible objectives that you actively pursue. Moreover, accountability often involves seeking guidance from mentors or peers who help keep you on track, providing a network of support that strengthens your resolve. 
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        This practice not only fosters financial discipline but also cultivates personal growth, as it encourages self-reflection and continuous improvement. In the context of your education and future aspirations, accountability can be the difference between success and stagnation, guiding you to take the necessary steps, stay focused, and fulfill your potential.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        By embracing accountability, you align your actions with your values, creating a foundation for lasting success, as the Babylonians wisely taught: “It is not the amount of money, but how it is handled that brings true wealth.”
