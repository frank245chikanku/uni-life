        Creating a Financial Safety Net
      </h1>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Creating a financial safety net, as inspired by the principles in The Richest Man in Babylon, is an essential step toward securing your future and protecting yourself from unexpected challenges.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        For students, this concept is particularly important because life is unpredictable, and preparing for uncertainties ensures you remain stable during tough times. A financial safety net begins with saving a portion of all your income, no matter how small. The Babylonians advised setting aside at least 10% of your earnings as the "first step toward wealth," and this principle remains timeless. Think of this as your bufferâ€”a reserve that shields you from emergencies, such as unexpected medical expenses, tuition adjustments, or unforeseen living costs.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Building this reserve requires discipline and patience; it means avoiding unnecessary spending and prioritizing your long-term security over short-term desires. Moreover, as you grow your savings, consider where you store it. Ensure your money is kept in a secure, easily accessible place where it can serve its purpose when needed. By consistently saving and safeguarding your financial resources, you create a safety net that not only provides peace of mind but also lays the groundwork for future opportunities.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        In doing so, you learn to live wisely and responsibly, embodying the ancient wisdom of the Babylonians, who taught that "good luck waits to bless those who are prepared." Start small, stay consistent, and let your financial safety net be your first shield in the journey toward financial independence.
