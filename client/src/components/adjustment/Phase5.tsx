        Phase 5: Crafting Your Own Path

        Let’s face it: life is full of rules. Sometimes they are explicit, like the ones that governed much of your life as a student. How to address your teachers. How to format your essays. And how not to start three consecutive sentences with the word "how." Because, let’s face it, it breaks the rules of grammar.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        But more often, the rules that govern our lives are more nuanced; less black and white. They’re the rules about what you’re supposed to do with your life – from what you should study to the kind of person you should marry to where you should one day send your own kids to school.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        All of these rules are intended to help you live a happier life, to enjoy more success, experience less angst, and fit in with the people around you. However, as you look towards the rest of your life, you have to be willing to challenge the rules that might otherwise limit what you do with it.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        As much as people around you may want you to succeed, no one else but you is responsible for your happiness and creating your own definition of success. So as you look toward the future, don’t allow yourself to be hemmed in by the rules that others live by. Sure, it may take courage to break apart from the pack.
