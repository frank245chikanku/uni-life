      <p>
        Checkpoints are valuable tools in any journey, whether it's personal or professional. 
        They allow you to break down long-term goals into manageable steps and provide opportunities 
        to review progress at key intervals. By setting up checkpoints, you can identify early signs 
        of success or areas that need improvement. These milestones keep you motivated, focused, and on track 
        toward achieving your final goal, while giving you the flexibility to adjust your approach if necessary.
