      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The Art of Direction is about mastering the delicate balance between clarity of purpose and the flexibility 
        to adapt. It’s not simply about knowing where you want to go—it’s about crafting a path that evolves as you 
        learn and grow, keeping your focus steady while allowing room for recalibration. Direction isn’t a rigid line; 
        it’s a dynamic force that guides you through life’s uncertainties.
        <br />
        <br />
        Think of it as steering a ship. You have a destination in mind, but the winds and tides may shift, requiring 
        you to adjust your course without losing sight of your goal. The art lies in your ability to remain steadfast 
        in your vision while navigating the obstacles and opportunities that arise along the way. It’s not enough to 
        move—you must move with intention.
        <br />
        <br />
        In a world full of distractions, the art of direction challenges you to define what truly matters. Whether it’s 
        building a career, nurturing relationships, or achieving personal growth, direction gives meaning to your efforts. 
        It encourages focus, resilience, and purpose. By mastering this art, you become not just a traveler in life but a 
        deliberate navigator, charting a course that aligns with your values and aspirations while embracing the journey itself.
