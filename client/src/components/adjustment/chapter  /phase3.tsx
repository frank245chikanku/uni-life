      <h1>Wandering and Wondering</h1>
      <p>
        In life, sometimes we find ourselves wandering—searching for meaning, purpose, or direction. 
        But wandering is not aimless; it is an opportunity for exploration, self-discovery, and growth. 
        As you wander, you begin to wonder about your path, the choices you’ve made, and the possibilities ahead. 
        This phase is about embracing the unknown and being open to new experiences, knowing that the answers will come with time and reflection.
