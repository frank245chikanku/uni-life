      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Much like a physical compass points to true north, your internal compass keeps you grounded in your purpose, even amidst chaos. 
        It’s not just about making decisions; it’s about making the right decisions—the ones that resonate with who you are and where 
        you want to go. Whether you’re a student charting your future, a professional navigating challenges, or someone seeking personal 
        growth, your compass within is always there to guide you.
        <br />
        <br />
        Trusting it requires courage, especially when the external noise tells you otherwise. But those who follow their inner compass often 
        find fulfillment, not because they took the easiest route, but because they chose the one that was truly theirs. By nurturing self-awareness, 
        reflecting on your priorities, and staying attuned to your internal guide, you unlock a life of direction, authenticity, and purpose.
