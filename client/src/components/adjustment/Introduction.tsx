        Introduction to Adjustment
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Adjustment is the process through which individuals or systems modify their behavior, thoughts, or operations to effectively respond to changing circumstances, environments, or challenges. It is a vital aspect of human experience, enabling individuals to navigate transitions and maintain balance in personal, social, or professional contexts.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        In psychology, adjustment is often associated with achieving harmony between oneâ€™s needs and external demands, contributing to mental well-being and effective functioning. In broader contexts, such as organizations or societies, adjustment reflects adaptability and resilience, ensuring continuity and progress amid change. The concept underscores the importance of flexibility and problem-solving as essential tools for growth and success.
