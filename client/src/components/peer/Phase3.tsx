        Phase 3: Groupthink and Conformity
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Groupthink and conformity are both social phenomena that illustrate how peer pressure can shape individual behavior within groups. Groupthink occurs when the desire for group cohesion and unanimity overrides individualsâ€™ ability to think independently or critically. In situations of groupthink, individuals may suppress dissenting opinions, leading to irrational or harmful decision-making. This dynamic often arises when people prioritize harmony over accuracy, resulting in decisions that may not align with individual or collective best interests.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        This indicates that peer pressure can be powerful enough to make individuals act against their own knowledge or beliefs to fit in with the group. This conformity is not limited to social settings but extends to organizations, where workplace norms and leadership styles can pressure employees to overlook ethical considerations for the sake of unity. For example, a strong culture of conformity in an organization might pressure employees to follow unethical practices, leading to moral dilemmas and cognitive dissonance as they struggle between personal ethics and the urge to fit in.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        To counteract these effects, organizations can create environments that prioritize open communication, ethical training, and supportive leadership.
