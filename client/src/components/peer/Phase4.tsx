        Phase 4: Communication and Assertiveness
      </h2>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Assertiveness is an important skill for dealing with peer pressure or influence. It involves expressing your opinions and standing up for your beliefs in a respectful and confident manner. When you face peer pressure, assertiveness can help you say no. It also helps you maintain your boundaries without damaging your relationships with your peers.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        How do you become assertive? Well, it involves being clear and direct in your communication. Use “I” statements instead of “you” statements. Stay calm and composed in the face of pressure. For example, instead of saying “You’re pressuring me to drink alcohol,” you could say “I don’t feel comfortable drinking alcohol, so I’m going to pass.” By using “I” statements, you are taking ownership of your feelings and decisions. Invariably, this makes it easier for your peers to understand and respect your boundaries.
