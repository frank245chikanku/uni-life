        Phase 1: Understanding Peer Pressure
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Peer pressure is a very real issue that affects many of the teenagers of the world today. It is a normal part of growing up. Peer pressure is basically a social pressure. This can be from family members, friends, or those persons who work together. When we think of the words “peer pressure”, what is the first thing that comes to mind? Majority of us would say that peer pressure is an influence from friends or classmates to do something we normally do not follow as a routine.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Peer pressure is the direct influence on people by peers who get encouraged to follow their peers by changing their habits, values, and behavior. The ‘teenage’ is the age when peer pressure plays a vital role. Peer pressure can be both positive as well as negative. It's up to the individual to make the best out of every situation. Peer pressure may always be there—we have to use it wisely as we navigate through life.
