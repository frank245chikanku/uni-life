      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        If you have people-pleaser tendencies, it can be difficult to say no. Sometimes it's because you don't 
        want to disappoint someone, or you're seeking approval. Many people hesitate to say no, even when they 
        are over-stressed, over-booked, and just too busy to take on anything else.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        If you struggle with this, then you’re not alone. But it's important to learn how to say no to people and 
        their requests when you're at capacity or simply don't want to do the thing. Being unable to set boundaries 
        and say no can contribute to more stress, which may eventually turn to resentment. Saying no is hard for many people. 
        So, we blurt out yes to requests we’d rather decline — and frequently end up regretting it.

        “We often believe that we are protecting other people by saying yes when we want to say no. But being transparent 
        about our feelings, needs, and limits leads to healthier, more authentic relationships.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        And saying no and honoring your feelings, needs, and limits also leads to a healthier you. Thankfully, saying no 
        is a skill anyone can build. The key is to keep practicing.
