        When you find your voice, you don’t find some new thing inside of you; instead, you find a little more of you.
        You find a little more freedom to speak, express, and to let yourself be heard. You find that your voice isn’t 
        anywhere other than inside of you or anyone else than who you are.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        You’ll read and hear people talk about developing your voice. It’s true: yes, you can develop your voice — 
        how you speak and write — and yes, the more you use it, the better you will get at speaking up. But don’t look 
        for or expect your voice to be anyone other than you, and don’t look for or expect it to say anything other 
        than what you have to say.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        The most important question to consider when you don’t feel like you’ve found your voice is: what are the stories 
        and who are the voices that keep you from speaking? If you don’t feel free to speak — and many of us don’t — there 
        are reasons you feel that way. Those stories need to be told, and the lies within them need to be challenged.
