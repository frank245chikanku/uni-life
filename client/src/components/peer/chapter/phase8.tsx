        A well-crafted “no” often includes a concise explanation, if necessary, and an acknowledgment of the other person’s needs or feelings.
        For example, instead of a curt “I can’t do this,” you might say, “I appreciate the opportunity, but I need to focus on my current commitments.” 
        This approach communicates your boundaries while maintaining respect and consideration.

        By learning to craft your “no” thoughtfully, you empower yourself to protect your time and energy without damaging your relationships.
