        Crafting Your No

        A well-crafted “no” often includes a concise explanation, if necessary, and an acknowledgment of the other person’s needs or feelings.
        For example, instead of a curt “I can’t do this,” you might say, “I appreciate the opportunity, but I need to focus on my current commitments.” 
        This approach communicates your boundaries while maintaining respect and consideration.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        By learning to craft your “no” thoughtfully, you empower yourself to protect your time and energy without damaging your relationships.
