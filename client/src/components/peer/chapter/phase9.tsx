        The influence spectrum serves as a framework for understanding the different ways power and influence operate in human interactions,
        from the most positive and collaborative forms to those that are more coercive or harmful. By recognizing where different tactics fall on this spectrum,
        individuals can navigate their personal and professional relationships more effectively,
        ensuring they are both ethical in their approach and aware of the potential impacts of their influence.
