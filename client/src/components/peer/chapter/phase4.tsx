        Diversity of thought is the reality that there is more than one way to think about something. 
        It’s understanding that the way each person interprets and interacts with the world is reflective 
        of their unique identity, culture, and personal experiences. The greater variation in approaches to 
        problems and unique perspectives, the greater the diversity of thought produced.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Diversity of thought elevates teams by fostering communication around individual perspectives and 
        creating a posture of thinking that’s beyond yourself. It’s a key ingredient to candid conversation, 
        innovation, and execution. Diversity of opinions and perspectives is paramount.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        It’s not just about visible demographic diversity but also about actively welcoming a broad spectrum 
        of thoughts, ideas, and viewpoints.
