        The Pressure to Conform
      </h1>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        There are many aspects of life that pressure us to be conformed. Growing up, there is peer pressure. 
        In many careers, people face the pressure to conform to long work hours. Friends often pressure us to 
        go places and do things we wouldn’t do otherwise.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        And there are spiritual pressures as well. Our spiritual enemies want to lead us away from godly living. 
        One of their tactics is to pressure us to be conformed to them. It’s hard to resist. The corrupt values of the world 
        are all around us, on TV, the Internet, Facebook, and movies. We live in a world that oozes forth with dishonesty, 
        immorality, and ungodliness.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        To conform as a preemptive strike against erasure is to live in a bubble that privileges only your way of thinking, 
        foreclosing on the possibility of free expression and the force that fuels every single piece of art.
