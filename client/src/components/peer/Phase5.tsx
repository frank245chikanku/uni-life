        Phase 5: Refusing Pressure Tactfully
      </h2>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Often, "just saying no" isn't enough, and young people must look inward at self-confidence and personal convictions to make good choices.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Learning to refuse peer pressure tactfully means understanding your own values and being able to communicate your boundaries without alienating others. This involves being respectful yet firm, and using strategies like suggesting alternatives, changing the subject, or removing yourself from the situation when needed. Practicing refusal skills regularly can build confidence and make it easier to stand firm in real-life scenarios.
