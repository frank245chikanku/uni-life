      <p>
      One of the most effective ways to deal with peer pressure or influence is to set clear boundaries. 
      This involves establishing your own values, beliefs, and goals.
      Let your friends know these principles about you. For example, if you do not drink alcohol or use drugs, make your stand clear to your peers.
      Similarly, if you are busy with academic work, donâ€™t give in when they convince you to engage in frivolous stuff.

       Setting clear boundaries can help you focus. If you focus, you can easily achieve your goals.
        And some cases you need to be odd to be able to achieve these goals.
        Another effective strategy for dealing with peer pressure or influence is to find like-minded peers. Just look for friends who share your values, beliefs, and goals. Only like-minded peers can create a supportive environment you need to excel. 
        Get people who will support you.
