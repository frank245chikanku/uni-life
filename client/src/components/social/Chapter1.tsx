        Phase 1: Understanding Social Responsibility
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Social responsibility is an ethical theory in which individuals are accountable for fulfilling their civic duty, and the actions of an individual must benefit the whole of society. In this way, there must be a balance between economic growth, the welfare of people, and the environment. If this equilibrium is maintained, then social responsibility is accomplished.
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The theory of social responsibility is built on a system of ethics, in which decisions and actions must be ethically validated before proceeding. If the action or decision causes harm to society or the environment, then it would be considered to be socially irresponsible.
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Moral values that are inherent in society create a distinction between right and wrong. In this way, social fairness is believed (by most) to be in the “right”, but more frequently than not this “fairness” is absent. Every individual has a responsibility to act in a manner that is beneficial to society and not solely to the individual.
