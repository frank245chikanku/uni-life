      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Social impact assessment (SIA) is now conceived as being the process of managing the social issues of development. There is consensus on what ‘good’ SIA practice is – it is participatory; it supports affected peoples, proponents, and regulatory agencies. It increases understanding of change and capacities to respond to change; it seeks to avoid and mitigate negative impacts and to enhance positive benefits across the life cycle of developments, and it emphasizes enhancing the lives of vulnerable and disadvantaged people.
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        We analyse the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats facing SIA. We assert that the SIA community needs to revisit core concepts, such as culture, community, power, human rights, gender, justice, place, resilience, and sustainable livelihoods.
