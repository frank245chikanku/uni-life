        Phase 2: The Role of Individuals
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        An individual's role in shaping society contributes to the overall functioning and progression of that society. People are shaped by society as well, as construction in their individual cognitive, behavioural, and emotional abilities are based off of the social order. Individuals are important because they are the support beam to society. Those with good stable values disrupt chaos and give hope to society that we can all go back to normal. People also contain a vast amount of knowledge that lies in their heads ready to be tapped into for society's benefit.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The social environment is made up of a number of factors that determine individual lives. One way in which society can socially control and artificially segment and compartmentalize but at the same time develop unity is by this thing we call culture. Culture allows those within the societal structure to communicate and socialize with each other about their obtainable, official, regional, religious, and secular views, groups, and subgroups through shared beliefs, rituals, music, cultural customs, food, and through the usage of language. It is learned, socially acquired, and in essence, distinguishes key factors between groups of people or individuals.
