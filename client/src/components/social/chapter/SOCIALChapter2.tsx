      <p>
        Global citizenship is about recognizing our shared humanity and embracing our responsibility 
        to contribute to a more just, sustainable, and peaceful world. It goes beyond national borders, 
        encouraging individuals to think critically about global issues such as climate change, poverty, 
        inequality, and human rights. A global citizen values diversity, seeks to understand different 
        cultures, and takes action to address the challenges facing our planet. By fostering empathy and 
        cooperation, global citizenship promotes a sense of interconnectedness, where individuals feel 
        empowered to make a positive impact on both local and global scales.
