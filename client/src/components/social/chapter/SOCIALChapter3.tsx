        Listening circles are a powerful tool for fostering deep understanding and connection within 
        a group. This practice encourages participants to listen actively and attentively to each 
        other without interruption, allowing each person to speak their truth in a safe and respectful 
        environment. 
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Listening circles promote empathy, respect, and mutual learning, as they create 
        space for diverse perspectives to be heard and valued. By engaging in listening circles, 
        individuals can strengthen their communication skills, resolve conflicts, and build stronger, 
        more inclusive communities.
