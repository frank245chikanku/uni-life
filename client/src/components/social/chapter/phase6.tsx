        Finding Meaning in Service
      </h1>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        “Only a life lived for others is a life worthwhile.” These words show how serving others can give our lives purpose and joy. 
        In a world focused on personal goals, service stands out. It lets us help others and make a real difference in their lives.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Service isn’t just about being nice. It’s about choosing to help with all your heart, showing you care. 
        By serving this way, we can make everyone’s life better. And we find ourselves growing and feeling more satisfied too.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Meaningful service experiences can change our lives deeply. They help us impact others positively. And they help us feel our lives are more meaningful.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Helping others means more than just the actions we take. It’s about seeing the worth in what we do, even the small things. Every bit of help can start a chain reaction, reaching others and inspiring further good deeds.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Service helps us discover who we are. By helping others, we find our unique skills and understand our passions. As we keep serving, we see what really matters and how we can help the world.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        “Service is not just about giving; it is about discovering who we are and what we are capable of.”
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Getting involved in meaningful service expands our perspectives. It fosters empathy and understanding of our diverse world. These experiences make us more thoughtful and caring.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        When we find our service purpose, we feel deeply satisfied. Making a positive difference fills us with joy. We see how serving can change both the receiver and the giver.
