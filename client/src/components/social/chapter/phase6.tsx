      <p>
        Finding meaning in service is about connecting with the deeper purpose behind helping others. 
        Service offers an opportunity to contribute to the well-being of individuals, communities, and 
        society at large, creating a sense of fulfillment and purpose. When we serve, we often realize 
        that true satisfaction comes not just from achieving personal success, but from making a difference 
        in the lives of others. The act of giving – whether through time, resources, or skills – cultivates 
        empathy, compassion, and a sense of interconnectedness. Ultimately, service enriches our lives, 
        providing meaning and a sense of belonging as we contribute to a collective good.
