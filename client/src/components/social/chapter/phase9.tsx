        Finding your place in the community, as Jordan B. Peterson might suggest, begins with taking responsibility for yourself and then extending that responsibility outward. 
        A community thrives when individuals contribute their unique skills and perspectives while also respecting the shared structure that holds it together.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        As students, your role is to identify your strengths, cultivate them with discipline, and use them to support and uplift those around you. 
        This process requires humility to learn from others, courage to confront challenges, and honesty to acknowledge where you can improve.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        By striving to make meaningful contributions, you not only grow as an individual but also help build a stronger, more cohesive communityâ€”one where your efforts ripple outward,
        creating a network of trust, collaboration, and shared purpose.
      </p>
