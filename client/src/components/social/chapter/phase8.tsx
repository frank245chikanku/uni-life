      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Truth is not merely about stating facts—it’s a profound commitment to aligning your words and actions with reality, no matter how uncomfortable or challenging that reality may be.
        Truth is what keeps chaos at bay and prevents order from becoming tyrannical; it’s the foundation upon which trust, integrity, and meaning are built.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        As students, telling the truth means being honest about your strengths and weaknesses, facing your failures without excuses, and striving to express your genuine thoughts,
        even when it’s difficult. By living truthfully, you cultivate personal responsibility, strengthen your character, and create a stable ground from which you can grow and contribute to the world meaningfully.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        While the path of truth is demanding, it is also the path that leads to freedom, resilience, and a life of deep significance.
