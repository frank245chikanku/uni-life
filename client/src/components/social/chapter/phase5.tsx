      <h1>Addressing Inequality</h1>
      <p>
        Addressing inequality is a critical step toward creating a more just and equitable society. Inequality 
        manifests in many forms—economic, social, racial, and educational—and affects individuals and communities 
        differently. Tackling inequality requires acknowledging these disparities and actively working to reduce the 
        barriers that prevent marginalized groups from accessing opportunities and resources. By advocating for 
        equal rights, improving access to education and healthcare, and promoting social inclusion, we can create 
        systems that empower all individuals to thrive. Addressing inequality not only benefits those directly 
        impacted, but also contributes to the overall well-being and progress of society as a whole.
