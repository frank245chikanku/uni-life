      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Inequality is an enduring feature of human existence. It manifests in various forms—social, economic, educational—and often leads to tension and suffering.
        However, as students, you are uniquely positioned to confront and address inequality in ways that are meaningful and transformative.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Addressing inequality is not about dismantling everything that exists but about transforming systems and empowering individuals.
        It starts with you—your education, your competence, your willingness to take responsibility.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        As Jordan B. Peterson often says, "You’re not everything you could be, and you know it." Use that knowledge as motivation to grow, act, and contribute to a world where inequality is reduced and opportunities are expanded. 
        Through courage, truth, and responsibility, you can be a force for meaningful change.
