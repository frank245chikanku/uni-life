      <p>
        Digital responsibility refers to the ethical use of technology and the internet, emphasizing the 
        importance of using digital platforms in a way that promotes respect, safety, and inclusivity. In 
        todayâ€™s interconnected world, individuals and organizations must be aware of the impact their digital 
        actions can have on others. This includes protecting personal data, avoiding online harm such as cyberbullying, 
        and ensuring that information shared is accurate and respectful. Digital responsibility also involves being 
        mindful of screen time, managing the balance between online and offline life, and using technology to 
        foster positive connections and learning. By embracing digital responsibility, we can contribute to a 
        healthier, safer, and more ethical online environment for everyone.
