        As students navigating a world deeply intertwined with technology, understanding and practicing digital responsibility is not just a skill but a necessity.
        Think of it as taking ownership of your actions and choices in the digital space, much like an author writing a story with deliberate intent, 
        shaping not just the narrative but the impact it leaves on readers.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        In this case, you are the author of your digital presence, and your choices define your contribution to the online world. 
        Digital responsibility is about crafting your online presence with care and intentionality, much like an author shaping a masterpiece. 
        Your actions today can influence not just your future but the broader digital world.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        By practicing ethical behavior, respecting privacy, exercising discipline, and fostering kindness, 
        you contribute to a healthier, more meaningful digital environment.
