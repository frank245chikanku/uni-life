      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Cultural awareness means being sensitive to the differences and similarities between two cultures when communicating or interacting with members of other cultural groups.
        Cultural sensitivity involves inculcating values, attitudes, and knowledge that display openness and respect for different cultures, religions, languages, manner of dress, and communication styles.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Cultural awareness involves raising peopleâ€™s understanding of the influence our culture has on how we do things, including how we communicate, what foods we eat, or even how we go about our work. 
        Being culturally aware means understanding why cultural diversity is important and recognizing that not every person will do things in the same manner as we do. 
        Being mindful of this diversity allows us to be more respectful of the way others operate based on their cultural backgrounds.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        While you may not be intimately familiar with other cultures, if you at least understand your own culture and how it affects you, you can take the first step in developing a sense of cultural awareness when it comes to interacting with people who may have a different background than yourself.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Cultural awareness helps you understand yourself better, your weaknesses, your psychology, and how to become a better person. 
        It also helps with cognitive flexibility, problem-solving, decision-making, and improved communication skills.
