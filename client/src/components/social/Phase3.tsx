        Phase 3: Social Impact Assessment
      </h2>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Social impact assessment (SIA) is now conceived as being the process of
        managing the social issues of development. There is consensus on what
        ‘good’ SIA practice is – it is participatory; it supports affected
        peoples, proponents, and regulatory agencies. It increases understanding
        of change and capacities to respond to change; it seeks to avoid and
        mitigate negative impacts and to enhance positive benefits across the
        life cycle of developments, and it emphasizes enhancing the lives of
        vulnerable and disadvantaged people.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        We analyse the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats facing
        SIA. We assert that the SIA community needs to revisit core concepts,
        such as culture, community, power, human rights, gender, justice,
        place, resilience, and sustainable livelihoods.
