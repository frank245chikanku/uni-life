      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The idea of finding mentors, not idols, emphasizes the importance of building relationships with individuals who can guide, challenge, and support personal and professional growth, rather than idolizing people from a distance. Mentors provide practical wisdom, constructive feedback, and personalized advice based on real experiences. 
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Unlike idols, who may appear perfect and distant, mentors offer a more accessible and realistic model of success, rooted in understanding and mutual growth. This approach helps individuals learn from someone who understands their unique circumstances and provides actionable insights. Instead of seeking unattainable perfection, focusing on mentorship allows for continuous development, with a mentor serving as a sounding board and a resource for overcoming obstacles.
