      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Especially for students, it's essential to think critically about the legacy they wish to leave behind. Defining your legacy involves understanding the impact you want to have on the world and shaping your actions accordingly. For students, this means not just focusing on grades or immediate accomplishments, but also considering how their work, character, and relationships will be remembered. 
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        I suggest that by consciously choosing to live with integrity, pursuing meaningful goals, and contributing to the well-being of others, students can begin to build a legacy that transcends temporary successes. Defining your legacy requires self-awareness and deliberate action, aligning your daily choices with your long-term values and aspirations. 
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        By doing so, students can create a sense of purpose and direction that guides them through challenges and ensures that their efforts are meaningful, both for themselves and for others.
