      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        We live in a culture that fixates on success. With personal and professional failures often filtered from our radar, we’re positioned only to appreciate the peaks in life’s journey — shying away from all valleys with fearful avoidance.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Yet it’s hardly a secret that some of the most successful entrepreneurs failed before achieving remarkable results. The late Steve Jobs was famously terminated from his own company before Apple became a household name. James Dyson created thousands of faulty, nonfunctional prototypes before patenting his best-selling vacuum. So, why do we forget the silver linings of these legendary failures when confronted with our own mistakes?
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Failure isn’t unlike a 5 a.m. jog on a Saturday morning; it might feel rough while you’re in the thick of it, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t serving a purpose.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Like many measures we take to improve our well-being, even the most unpleasant failures can be healthy in the long run. When plans don’t go as we hoped or anticipated, we reflect on our decision-making process and adjust our understanding.
