      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Cynicism, which can stem from a sense of disillusionment or a belief that things are inherently flawed, can be a significant barrier to personal and academic growth. Peterson argues that students, especially in today's world, must avoid becoming cynical about their education, society, or themselves. Instead, they should focus on taking responsibility for their own lives, cultivating a mindset of growth, and embracing the challenges that come with learning and self-improvement.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        By resisting cynicism, students are better equipped to confront the complexities of life with optimism and purpose, seeing the opportunities for development rather than focusing on the negatives. Students should recognize that while the world may be imperfect, they have the power to shape their own path and contribute positively to society, which is a far more empowering mindset than one rooted in cynicism.
