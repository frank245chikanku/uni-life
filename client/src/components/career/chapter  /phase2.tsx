        The gist: we're usually told to "think big" when it comes to goal setting. But here's why that doesn't always work, why you should set smaller goals, and 4 ways to break down big goals into smaller ones.
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I’ve been thinking about all the talk about how most people don’t meet their goals or stick to their resolutions.
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        It’s usually cited as proof that the entire concept doesn’t work, and that you shouldn’t bother setting them in the first place.
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        But what if that’s not true? What if we’re the problem, and most of us are just setting the wrong goals and resolutions in the first place?
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        What if we set ourselves up for failure, and then blame the tactic for our mistake, like in the saying “it’s a poor craftsman who blames his tools?”
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The benefit of micro habits is that you should be able to perform it with minimal effort every day. It’s important to execute on a new ritual daily so it becomes second nature, and if it’s small enough, you won’t be as tempted to defer your task from one day to the next. However, no matter the size of the task, it’s easy to get distracted, make excuses, or forget.
      </p>

        Perform your new action at the same time as (or right before) an action you do without thinking. Need to read a paragraph each night? You can do that while brushing your teeth. Meditating for 30 seconds each day? Check that off your list while waiting for your coffee to brew.
