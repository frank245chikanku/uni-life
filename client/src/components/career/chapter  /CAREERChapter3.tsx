        There is, however, an invitation to be grounded in reality.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        To be grounded in reality is to be firmly connected with life, both the good and the bad. It’s not avoiding the tough work of day-to-day life in favor of chasing a wisp of a lie.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        It’s getting advice, being okay with failures, giving grace to yourself and others. It’s totally real and thoroughly honest. It’s vulnerable.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        People who are grounded in reality are lovers of truth.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Nothing changes the human heart so deeply as to look bad in the presence of love, to be seen with all that is wickedly ugly about us and still be wanted, more, to be delighted in.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">How to become grounded</h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Review where your sense of self-worth comes from.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        We want to impress, to be loved and valued, and so subtly, we place our self-worth into the fickle hands of others.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        If you’re dancing to another’s tune, you will never discover the beautiful song within yourself.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Perhaps your self-worth comes from your own sense of achievement.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        You’re only as worthy as the success you achieve. If that’s the case, then how do you handle failure?
