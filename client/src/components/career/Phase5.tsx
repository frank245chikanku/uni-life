      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Competencies are the skills, attributes, and expertise that can be applied in the workplace.
        It's essential to build competence to improve the quality and efficiency of your work.
        Learning how to build competence helps you improve productivity and advance your career.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Developing competence involves identifying the skills, talents, characteristics, and knowledge you require to perform your job effectively and training or practicing to improve them.
        Taking time to enhance competence helps you improve your job performance, allowing you to advance your career.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        It's essential to identify the competencies you want to develop and improve so you can set goals and objectives to achieve them. Perform an objective self-evaluation to determine which competencies aren't your strongest or which you require if you want to advance your career. 
        Ask your colleagues and superiors for advice on what attributes you can improve.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Once you identify areas for improvement, set goals to determine how you're going to improve them.
        Identify a significant goal, such as improving a specific competency within a particular period.
