        Phase 3: Define Your Values
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Values are the deepest desires of your heart—they provide a scaffolding for how you want to interact with others, yourself, and the world in general.
        This is why consciously choosing which values you want to espouse is so imperative. Ironically, if you don’t take the time to consciously define and construct a framework of your personal values,
        you will still embody values—unfortunately, they may just not be the ones you thought you were striving for. To avoid this, you must take the time to consciously identify your core values,
        and then work through how living those values would look in your daily life.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Think of the process of defining your values as constructing your personal life rudder. A rudder (commonly used on ships, boats, submarines, and aircraft) is a primary steering device that operates by altering the movement of water or air, allowing the vehicle to turn or yaw in a particular direction.
        The rudder is absolutely crucial to the vehicle moving towards its desired orientation—you can think of it as a built-in compass. Without a well-constructed or well-defined rudder,
        a vehicle is much more likely to move aimlessly, without ever making any meaningful progress.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        In essence, without your rudder of personal values being deliberately defined, it is very easy to drift along, tossed around by the vagaries of life. One key to averting this aimlessness is to ask yourself:
        <strong> “What valued direction do I want to move in?” </strong>
        and <strong> “Which values would help me head there?”</strong>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
